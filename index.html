        <p>
          A 2017 review of clinical trials found that drinking coffee is
          generally safe within usual levels of intake and is more likely to
          improve health outcomes than to cause harm at doses of 3 or 4 cups of
          coffee daily. Exceptions include possible increased risk in women
          having bone fractures, and a possible increased risk in pregnant women
          of fetal loss or decreased birth weight. Results were complicated by
          poor study quality, and differences in age, gender, health status, and
          serving size.

          Coffee beans are the seeds of a fruit called a coffee cherry. Coffee
          cherries grow on coffee trees from a genus of plants called Coffea.
          There are a wide variety of species of coffee plants, ranging from
          shrubs to trees.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Type of bean.</b> There are two main types of coffee species,
            Arabica and Robusta. Arabica originates from Ethiopia and produces a
            mild, flavorful tasting coffee. It is the most popular type
            worldwide. However, it is expensive to grow because the Arabica
            plant is sensitive to the environment, requiring shade, humidity,
            and steady temperatures between 60-75 degrees Fahrenheit. The
            Robusta coffee plant is more economical to grow because it is
            resistant to disease and survives in a wider range of temperatures
            between 65 - 97 degrees Fahrenheit. It can also withstand harsh
            climate changes such as variations in rainfall and strong sunlight.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Type of roast.</b> Coffee beans start out green. They are roasted
            at a high heat to produce a chemical change that releases the rich
            aroma and flavor associate with coffee. They are then cooled and
            ground for brewing. Roasting levels range from light to medium to
            dark. The lighter the roast, lighter the color and roasted flavor
            and the higher its acidity and a bitter roasted flavor. The popular
            french roast is medium-dark
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Type of grind.</b> A medium grind is the most common and used for
            automatic drip coffee makers. A fine grind is used for deeper
            flavors like espresso, releases the oils, and a coarse grind is used
            in coffee presses.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Decaffeinated coffee. </b>This is an option for those who
            experience unpleasant side effects from caffeine. The two rnost

                donuts and coffee in Quincy, Massachusetts (a suburb of Boston),
                but he changed the name in 1950 to Dunkin' Donuts after discussing
                with company executives.[11][12] He conceived the idea for the
                restaurant after his experiences selling food in factories and at
                construction sites, where donuts and coffee were the two most
                popular items.

                McCafe in Australia in the year 1993. McCafe proved to be more
                successful than the fast food chain itself and is the largest
